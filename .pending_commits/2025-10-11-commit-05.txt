feat(cache): integrate unified cache into My Profile page (posts + favorites) with event-driven invalidation

- add api-cache/my.js: getMyInfo/getMyPosts/getMyFavorites + invalidate helpers (no TTL, manual invalidation)
- pages/profile/profile.vue:
  - import cache helpers and switch loadMyPosts/loadFavorites to cached versions (early-return usage)
  - bind uni events in checkLoginAndFetchData():
    * avatar-updated → invalidateMyInfo + refresh info
    * post-created → invalidateMyPosts + refresh posts
    * favorite-changed → invalidateMyFavorites + refresh favorites (only for My Profile)
- no cloudfunctions changed; behavior respects your rule:
  * user-profile: refresh on avatar/post only
  * My Profile: also refresh on favorite changes
